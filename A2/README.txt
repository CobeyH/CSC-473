System Feature Description

All features described in the assignment handout have been implemented to completion.
This includes 
[4] Particle system: Including adding particles, moving particles and particle rendering
[4] Script commands: All 10 script commands have been implemented and perform the desired operation. 
Integration Techniques
[3] Forward Euler - fully implemented
[3] Verlet - fully implemented
[3] Symplectic Euler - fully implemented
[4] Ground forces: Ground detection and resolution has been implemented and can be modified using the script commands.
[1] Gravity - Fully implemented
[1] Locking of a particle’s position - Particles can be locked with the “fix” command. An additional command was created called “unfix” that will free a particle. The command can be invoked using “simulator <simulator name> unfix <particle index>”. Ex “simulator partSim unfix 0”. 
[2] Particle and spring drawing - Particles and springs are drawn and updated on every simulation step. The particles are always drawn as points for performance reasons.

No features have been excluded from this implementation of the A2 solution.
